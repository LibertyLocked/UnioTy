Connect IoT devices to your Unity game!

## Features
- Allows IoT devices to react to in-game events
- Allows your game to respond to events published by IoT devices

  - TCP for triggers (e.g. button presses and releases)
  - UDP for PWM and analog data (e.g. temperature readings, ultrasonic ranger readings)
- Event-based callbacks
- When used with VR, you can control real objects through virtual objects, and vice versa
